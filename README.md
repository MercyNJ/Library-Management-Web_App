   <h2>Features</h2>
   <p>The web app allows the librarian to perform 4 main functions in regards to streamlining operations:</p>
   <h3>Members Records Management:</h3>
   <p>This functionality enables the librarian effortless access, addition, and removal of library members, optimizing operational efficiency. The web app replaces manual record-keeping with a modern, efficient solution for a seamless user experience.</p>

   <h3>Issuance Creation:</h3>
   <p>Within the web app, the librarian can effortlessly issue books. The process involves selecting a member from a dropdown menu, specifying books and quantities & setting a due date A warning is triggered if the selected quantity exceeds the available book stock, ensuring precision in both book issuance and books stock management.</p>

   <h3>Statements of Reminder Generation:</h3>
   <p>Utilizing the web app, the librarian can effortlessly access a compilation of all active issuances, encompassing issuances whose return status is either overdue or borrowed. Additionally, the librarian can filter for active issuances pertaining to a specific member by either their ID or name. With this information, generating a statement of reminder for the chosen member is a straightforward processâ€”simply by clicking the "Generate Statement" button.</p>

   <h2>Usage:</h2>
   <p>As this web application is currently tailored for a specific library, its use requires authentication. Upon accessing the designated domain in the browser, the librarian is directed to the initial login page where they must authenticate with their credentials. Additionally, they have the capability to change their password during this login process.</p>

   <p>Once successfully logged in, they gain access to the home page, where a sidebar menu facilitates easy navigation to various sections of the web application. From the home page, the librarian can efficiently manage members and books records, create new entries, issue books and generate statements of reminder as needed. Furthermore, the option to download the issuance records or statements is readily available for their convenience.</p>

   <h2>Technical Challenges Overcome</h2>
   <h3>Handling many-to-many data models relationships</h3>
   <p>Faced with the intricate challenges of managing many-to-many relationships, I took it upon myself to dive deep into the inner workings of Libra Web's data architecture. Guided by insights from SQLAlchemy documentation, I forged ahead, introducing association tables to forge clear connections between books and issuances. This endeavor demanded extensive fine-tuning across the application, every adjustment made with precision. The result? A robust foundation laid for enhanced performance and user satisfaction, setting the stage for a seamless experience as I embarked on the development journey with the application.</p>

   <h3>User Authentication</h3>
   <p>Implementing user authentication with Flask Login posed challenges that I effectively addressed. Errors arose, including misconfigurations in user session setup and data retrieval issues. A meticulous review of the Flask Login documentation proved instrumental. Specific challenges encountered and resolved included fine-tuning user session management and addressing intricacies in data retrieval. This experience underscored the importance of detailed documentation exploration, enhancing my proficiency in seamlessly integrating Flask Login for secure user authentication.</p>

   <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
   <p>As of now, I've conducted tests for the console, the database storage file, and the models. Going forward, my focus will be on expanding the test coverage to include functionalities within each Flask folder. This will encompass various aspects such as members, books, issuances, and statements, ensuring comprehensive testing across all components of the application. I am also working on deploying the app on PythonAnywhere.</p>
